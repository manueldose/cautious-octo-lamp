### What I learned

I've improved my knowledge with html and css. Mainly working with classes, applying logical ways

```css
.layout-payment {
  width: 90%;
  min-inline-size: 18rem;
  max-inline-size: 25rem;
  max-block-size: 9.37rem;
  margin: 15px auto;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bolder;
  background-color: rgb(59, 17, 245);
  border: none;
  border-radius: .5rem;
  box-shadow: 0 6px 22px rgb(59 17 245 / 36%);
  align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I would like to continue acquiring more knowledge around the world of responsive. And to deepen and settle more knowledge in css
